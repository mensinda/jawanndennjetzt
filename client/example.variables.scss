/*
 * Example theme customization file for Bootswatch themes.
 *
 * Any available Bootswatch theme can be used to style the application, which
 * can further be customized to tweak the appearance even more precisely.
 *
 * This is done by overriding the default values of the `_variables.scss` file
 * provided by the selected Bootswatch theme. The default variables for each
 * theme can be inspected on the [Bootswatch GitHub](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch)
 * under `dist/<theme>/_variables.scss`.
 *
 * To get started on such a custom theme modification, copy this file to a
 * new `variables.scss` and alter any variables within to better suit your
 * desired appearance.
 *
 * The `variables.scss` file will then be automatically detected by the setup script.
 *
 * NOTE: The final `variables.scss` **MUST** be in the `client` directory!
